# GeometricMania

Wizard of Oz Solutions has received a request for a tool that will allow users to easily calculate the area of various geometric shapes.

The program needs to provide a menu for the user, allowing them to select the shape for which they need the area calculated.  Depending on the shape selected, the appropriate information should be gathered from the user and a function called that will calculate the area of the selected shape.

The user should be allowed to calculate the area for as many shapes as they wish, being given an option to end the program.

Since Wizard of Oz Solutions is an advocate of modular code and code reuse, the program will need to written using functions that calculate the area of the various shapes.

The shapes for which area must be required are circle, square, rectangle, and right triangle.  The function declarations for the area functions are as follows:

  def circleArea(radius:float):

  def squareArea(side:float):
  
  def rectangleArea(length:float, width:float):
  
  def triangleArea(base:float, height:float):
